Simple Calculator Project

This is a simple calculator project.  It performs simple calculations.  With the display element, I learned about using text-overflow with ellipsis, white-space with nowrap, and overflow:hidden.  When hovering over the buttons, cursor:pointer is activated, changing the mouse arrow into a little hand, which was new for me.  

In JS, this project uses the document.getElementById("display") method to manipulate the HTML display element.  

There is also a switch statement for the operators involved with performing the calculations.

It was good practice.
